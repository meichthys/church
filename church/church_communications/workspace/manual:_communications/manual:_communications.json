Missionary Mike sends a prayer letter that he would like read to the church.<br>2. The Church Secretary receives the letter, navigates to `Missions &gt; Missionaries &gt; Missionary Mike &gt; Letters to the Church` and adds the letter to the Missionary Mike document making note that the letter should be read to the church.<br>3. Before the next church service, the Pastor runs the `Missions &gt; Letters` report and filters by 'Share w/ Church` to see which letters need to be read.<br>4. The letters are added to the `Church Event Schedule` for the next `Church Event` (Service).<br>5. Missionary Mike's `Missionary` document can be updated with a date to show that the letter was read to the church.\",\"col\":12}}]",
